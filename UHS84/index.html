        <h1>Unley High School Class of 1984 - 40 year reunion</h1> 
        <p class="p1">If you were a UHS student in or teacher of year 8 in 1980, year 12 in 1984, or something like that and you want to reconnect with others who were in your class(es) then know that we are planning a 40th year reunion.</p>

        <p class="p1">We've organised a flexible evening to cater for as many as possible. Dinner at the Arkaba in a private room for those who want a more of an evening to connect and reminisce, then extending the evening in the same room for those who want to pop in for drinks and chats. The Ark has been chosen because it also has accomodation for those who need it.</p>
        <p class="p1">Details:
          <ul class="p1"><li><b>When:</b> Saturday April 13th - 6pm for dinner with others able to come in from 7:30pm</li>
          <li><b>Where:</b> <a href="https://www.arkabahotel.com.au/" target="_blank">Arkaba Hotel</a> 150 Glen Osmond Road, Fullarton SA 5063</li>
          <li><b>Dress code:</b> neat casual</li>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> We are requesting a $10pp cover charge for those coming for dinner to help with room hire. For those just coming for drinks later a donation would be appreciated. If you are struggling too much with cost of living to afford this please get in touch as we would rather have you there than miss out due to cost. If we have enough to cover room hire then any excess will go to helping with taxi fares or getting nibbles to share etc.</li></ul>
