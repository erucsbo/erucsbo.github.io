<h1>SUPA SUMMA FUN</h1>
<h2>Mannum 2022</h2>
<p>January 10-13 - 10am-12pm - Mary Ann Reserve - <b>and Talent Show on Thursday evening (see below)</b></p>
<p>This year (like last year) we will be running open-air stall-based activities and events.<br>
    If there is enough interest we also intend to run a talent show (for anyone to put on an act/skit/performance) on Thursday evening.<br>
    We ask that parents/guardians maintain responsibility for their children during this time but otherwise don't need to be directly involved.<br>
    There will be a SA Gov QR check-in available.</p>
