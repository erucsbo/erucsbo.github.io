<h1>SUPA SUMMA FUN</h1>
<h2>Mannum 2022</h2>
<p>January 10-13 - 10am-12pm - Mary Ann Reserve</p>
<p>This year (like last year) we will be running open-air stall-based activities and events.<br>
    If there is enough interest we also intend to run a talent show (for anyone to put on an act/skit/performance) on Thursday evening.<br>
    We ask that parents/guardians maintain responsibility for their children during this time but otherwise don't need to be directly involved.<br>
    There will be a SA Gov QR check-in available.</p>
<p>If you would like to be kept up to date on what is happening <a href="https://forms.gle/NoCoee9iUSoPhssg9" target="_blank">please provide your contact details and any comments.</a></p>
<p>or access the form via<br> <img src="./regoform.JPG" width="350" alt="QR code for registering interest" /></p>
